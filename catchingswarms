Each node/site consists of upto 10 bait hives. The equipment supplied for each node is as follows:

•	10 x assembled 40L nucleus hive boxes with identification labels and warning signage
•	30 x full depth frames and new wax foundation 
•	20 x star pickets and mountings for nucleus boxes
•	1 x 200mL swarm lure and sprayer.
•	8 x 250mL plastic sample jars
•	4 x cardboard mailing box (approx 190mm x 100mm x 100mm)
•	4 x return-addressed mailing labels
•	electrical tape (sealing/anti-leakage)
•	Styrofoam packing
•	plastic re-sealable bags
•	bubble wrap
•	mailing labels and fragile sticker
•	1 x instruction sheet
•	2 L ethanol

Each site will be examined at least monthly for bee activity, and once a swarm has been detected, it will immediately be sampled and cleared, freeing the box to be re-used for the next potential European honeybee swarm. 

The equipment in the following diagram is supplied for the purposes of sending samples to the ANU. Each beekeeper will receive an initial allocation sufficient for four tests and return mail to the ANU in Canberra.

Figure 5 - Single sampling kit

Sampling will involve the following steps:
1.	Collect approximately 200-500 workers (about 1 cup) into one of the supplied sampling jar. 
2.	Collect two 30 cm2 comb samples containing at least 10 pollen and 20 brood cells. 
3.	Using two separate sample jars, fill one sample jar with bees and the other with the honeycomb samples. Cover both samples with the supplied ethanol – usually about 60-80 percent of the volume of the sampling jar Only use the supplied ethanol. Do not use methylated spirit as this has additives which may damage the sample. 
4.	Seal each jar with the supplied tape ensuring coverage of the join of the lid around the entire circumference of the sampling container.
