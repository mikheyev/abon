## What do you hope to achieve?
We are collecting baseline data about honey bees -- population levels, genetic structure, their pathogens, as well as what plants they pollinate. The network acts as an early warning system for Varroa, and provides a wealth of data about bee populations, and how they may change if Varroa becomes established.This information is crucial in furthering investigation of the ecological role of honey bees, and aims to help protect food security by providing information on the potential impact of Varroa on honey bees and pollination services.

## Varroa
### What is Varroa? Where did it come from?
Varroa mites (*Varroa destructor*) were native mite to a close relative of the western honey bee (*Apis mellifera*). Western honey bees are used in beekeeping worldwide, but were originally limited to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. They were brought to Asia, where in the mid-20th century Varroa mites adopted them as a new host. Since then, Varroa mites have spread worldwide, spreading deadly viruses, and leading to widespread bee population collapses.

### Will Varroa kill Australian honey bees?
In short, no. 

However, the reality of varroaâ€™s impact is much more complicated than that. Worldwide, bee populations have shown an ability to evolve resistance to the mites. Managed colonies will most likely have to be treated with chemicals to manage Varroa levels, but that's been the worldwide practice for decades. There is novel and exciting research on Varroa control that will rely less on chemicals going forward.
