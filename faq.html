<p>We are collecting baseline data about honey bees – population levels, genetic structure, their pathogens, as well as what plants they pollinate. The network acts as an early warning system for Varroa, and provides a wealth of data about bee populations, and how they may change if Varroa becomes established.This information is crucial in furthering investigation of the ecological role of honey bees, and aims to help protect food security by providing information on the potential impact of Varroa on honey bees and pollination services.</p>

<h2 id="varroa">Varroa</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-varroa-where-did-it-come-from">What is Varroa? Where did it come from?</h3>
<p>Varroa mites (<em>Varroa destructor</em>) were native mite to a close relative of the western honey bee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>). Western honey bees are used in beekeeping worldwide, but were originally limited to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. They were brought to Asia, where in the mid-20th century Varroa mites adopted them as a new host. Since then, Varroa mites have spread worldwide, spreading deadly viruses, and leading to widespread bee population collapses.</p>

<p>You can read more about Varroa mites <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/here%E2%80%99s-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-varroa-mite">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="will-varroa-kill-australian-honey-bees">Will Varroa kill Australian honey bees?</h3>
<p>In short, no.</p>

<p>However, the reality of varroa’s impact is much more complicated than that. Worldwide, bee populations have shown an ability to evolve resistance to the mites. Managed colonies will most likely have to be treated with chemicals to manage Varroa levels, but that’s been the worldwide practice for decades. There is novel and exciting research on Varroa control that will rely less on chemicals going forward.</p>

<h3 id="are-native-bees-in-danger">Are native bees in danger?</h3>
<p>Varroa mites are very host-specific and there is no chance of them switching to Australian native bees, which are only distantly related to honey bees. However, there is evidence that Varroa-vectored viruses spill over into native ecosystems, and we should study their effects to make sure no harm is done.</p>

<p>A predicted decline in feral honey bee populations may even benefit native bees, as they are generally out-competed by the honey bees for floral resources.</p>
