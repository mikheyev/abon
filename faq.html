    <h2 id="what-do-you-hope-to-achieve">What do you hope to achieve?</h2>
<p>We are collecting baseline data about honey bees – population levels, genetic structure, their pathogens, as well as what plants they pollinate. The network acts as an early warning system for Varroa, and provides a wealth of data about bee populations, and how they may change if Varroa becomes established.This information is crucial in furthering investigation of the ecological role of honey bees, and aims to help protect food security by providing information on the potential impact of Varroa on honey bees and pollination services.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-focus-on-feral-honey-bees">Why the focus on feral honey bees?</h3>

<p>Feral honey bees exist at densities of up to 100 colonies per km<sup>2</sup>, their numbers dwarfing the managed bee population. Yet, because of their well-hidden nests, we know little about them. We want to know how they are different from managed bees, and how they will respond to Varroa. Importantly, feral honey bees have quickly evolved resistance to Varroa, and we hope to harness these genes to eventually breed managed bees that are also resistant to Varroa.</p>

<h2 id="varroa">Varroa</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-varroa-where-did-it-come-from">What is Varroa? Where did it come from?</h3>
<p>Varroa mites (<em>Varroa destructor</em>) were native mites to a close relative of the western honey bee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>). Western honey bees are used in beekeeping worldwide, but were originally limited to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. They were brought to Asia, where in the mid-20th century Varroa mites adopted them as a new host. Since then, Varroa mites have spread worldwide, spreading deadly viruses and leading to widespread bee population collapses.</p>

<p>You can read more about Varroa mites <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/here%E2%80%99s-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-varroa-mite">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="will-varroa-kill-australian-honey-bees">Will Varroa kill Australian honey bees?</h3>
<p>In short, no.</p>

<p>However, the reality of varroa’s impact is much more complicated than that. Worldwide, bee populations have shown an ability to evolve resistance to the mites. Managed colonies will most likely have to be treated with chemicals to manage Varroa levels, but that’s been the worldwide practice for decades. There is novel and exciting research on Varroa control that will rely less on chemicals going forward.</p>

<h3 id="are-native-bees-in-danger">Are native bees in danger?</h3>
<p>Varroa mites are very host-specific and there is no chance of them switching to Australian native bees, which are only distantly related to honey bees. However, there is evidence that Varroa-vectored viruses spill over into native ecosystems, and we should study their effects to make sure no harm is done.</p>

<p>A predicted decline in feral honey bee populations may even benefit native bees, as they are generally out-competed by the honey bees for floral resources.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a beekeeper, you can join the network by hosting a site. We will provide all the material to trap swarms, collect samples and mail them back, so all you need to donate is a bit of your time and commit to surveys for three years.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="i-am-in-a-red-zone-can-i-participate">I am in a Red Zone, can I participate?</h3>

<p>Yes! While the current goal is to eliminate all bees within Red Zones, the extent to which this is technically possible with feral bees is still unclear. Collections from Red Zones provide valuable information about the extent of the infestation, and an early look at any sort of ecological and evolutionary effects.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-in-a-purple-zone-can-i-participate">I am in a Purple Zone, can I participate?</h3>

<p>Yes, monitoring Purple Zones will provide valuable information about the natural spread of Varroa. Detecting in Purple Zones (and outside) will directly lead to immediate management decisions under the <a href="https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/emergencies/biosecurity/current-situation/varroa-mite-emergency-response">Emergency Order</a>.</p>
